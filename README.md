___TODO___

- Add a message to confirm if you really want to delete a Category
- When deleting a Category, check before if it's been used. If any product is assigned to this Category, show a message to warn the admin and don't delete it
- In forms, add input helper inside the input. I've tried using placeholder tag but it doesn't work. It's important for Product.Length
- Add /// comments to some methods
